1. Open config.yml (notepad++ is best)

    a. Edit host to the node you would like to use. The node must support txPool. If it doesn't you will receive an error.

    b. Enter your private key in the private key field. For maximum security you should create a new wallet then transfer 
        only the funds you need and use this wallet.

    c. Enter the amount you would like to buy. This must be less than the maximum buy for the presale.
    
    d. Enter the address of the presale. Make sure to not enter the token address.
    e. Adjust the percent fill to your liking. For example, if you would like the bot to buy when the presale has filled 
        to 50/100 BNB hard cap, enter 50. A lower value is more likely to succeed.

    f. Enter either pinksale or unicrypt as the action. Currently these are the only two platforms supported.

2. Run bot by either double clicking or navigating to the folder then executing the bot.

    a. Enter your license key, make sure there are no extra white spaces.

3. Run the bot again. You should eventually get a message counting down until the start of the presale.
